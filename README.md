## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

>SeaFoodKart is an online seafood store founded by Ramesh. Ramesh is CEO and is also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry to enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and drive sales. 
>SeaFoodKart  offers a wide range of seafood products delivered directly to customers' doorsteps, with a focus on quality, convenience, and sustainability. 
>SeaFoodKart is an online seafood store. When people visit their website, they're on a journey, like going through a funnel. At the top of the funnel are all the people who visit the site, and at the bottom are the ones who actually buy something. 
>But, not everyone who visits ends up buying. Some people might leave before even looking at the products, some might add things to their cart but then change their mind, and some might start to buy but then decide not to. 
>SeaFoodKart wants to figure out where exactly people are dropping out of this journey, like where they're leaving without buying anything. This helps them understand what parts of their website or the buying process might be turning people away. For example, maybe the website is hard to navigate, or maybe the prices are too high.
>By figuring this out,  SeaFoodKart can make changes to their website or how they sell things online to try and keep more people from leaving without buying. It's all about making the buying process smoother and more appealing, so more people end up making a purchase.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Data Preparation
1. To perform exploratory data analysis, I have combined all the above tables as 'final_raw_data'.
2. To perform analysis at Product level, I have formed a new table 'Product_level_summary'.
3. To perform analysis at Product category level, I have formed a new table 'Product_level_summary'.
4. I have created a new table 'visit_summary' that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record.
